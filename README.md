Genesis / MegaDrive Emulator
============================

This emulator is being written just for fun and for teaching to friends how to write
game emulators. It is not meant to ever grow user-friendly features for now,
and can just be used as a source code reference on how emulators works. It focuses
only on accuracy (not performance).
